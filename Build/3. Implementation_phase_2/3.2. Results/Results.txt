Results:

After feeding the validation dataset to the trained model, we measured each machine learning classifier model's accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score. 
Also compared the confusion matrix for all models. 

Out of all the models, Random Forest classifier had the highest accuracy, at 64.38 percent. 
The lowest accuracy was provided by the Decision Tree classifier, which was 53.42 percent.
While Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression both provided results of 60.27 percent and 56.16 percent, respectively.
