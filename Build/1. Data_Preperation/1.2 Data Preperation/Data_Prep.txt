While cleaning the data we initially focused on creating target vectors. 
As the research classifies whether the trial will be completed or not completed, the status column is the best fit for creating target vectors. 
Different status such as 'Completed', 'Recruiting', 'Active, not recruiting', 'Terminated','Unknown status', 'Not yet recruiting', 'Enrolling by invitation', 'Withdrawn', 'Suspended' unique values. 
We kept the completed values as it is and changed the remaining values to not completed status. 


Basic text cleaning steps were implemented on protocol documents as well as metadata. 
Extracted the PDF link from the document column and stored in the dataframe. 
At last created a dataframe consisting of ‘NCT numbet’, ‘Status’, ‘Conditions’, ‘Sponsor/Collaborators’, ‘Age’, ‘Sponsor/Collaborators’, ‘Study Design', ‘Location’ and ’Links'.
