Behavioral modifications or relaxation of glycemic control aiming to improve hypoglycemia awareness are prohibited.  9.10 Efficacy Measurements 9.10.1 Primary Objective Assessment The primary objective assessment will be  done through the determining the total and self-reported hypoglycemic events based on CGM data and hypoglycemia diary, respectively.  A single CGM hypoglycemic episode will be defined by any CGM readings < 70 mg/dL, followed by at least one reading ≥ 70 mg/dL from the Dexcom Professional Mobile CGM system.  A subject’s self -reported hypoglycemic episode will be defined by a hypoglycemic symptom record on the hypoglycemia diary with a confirmatory glucose value (glucometer value < 70 mg/dL, or CGM glucose value < 70 mg/dL if glucometer value is not available), or an incidental glucometer value < 70 mg/dL if no hypoglycemia symptom develops. The Hypoglycemia Event Report includes the initial glucometer value and time  and treatment time; the first and the most prominent symptom during the hypoglycemia episode; whether the episode requires outside help (sever e hypoglycemia). At the end of each hypoglycemia event report/CGM assessment  (i.e., visits 2 and 4), CGM data will be downloaded into a secure system and exported into an Excel format, and Hypoglycemic Event Reports will be collected for analysis.  The primary objective to determine whether propranolol increases the recognition of hypoglycemic events will be determined by an increase in the ratio of self - reported hypoglycemic events over total (i.e. CGM) hypoglycemic events while subjects are in the intervention period treated with propranolol compared to placebo. 9.10.2 Secondary Objective Assessment Data for the secondary objective assessment s will be collected through hypoglycemia awareness questionnaires (Gold, Clark and Pedersen- Bjergaard) [25-27], CGM data, and Fear of Hypoglycemia Questionnaire [28] .  The questionnaires will be completed by study subjects at the first, second and the last visit of the study. The questionnaires and CGM data will be used to determine changes in hypoglycemia awareness, severity and duration of hypoglycemia, onset- to- diagnosis/treatment and diagnosis/treatment -to-recovery durations, fear of hypoglycemia, and overall mean blood glucose values in subjects during the intervention period treated with propranolol compared to placebo.

For this reason, the event \nrate and incidence of hypogl ycemia accompanied by a  m easured glucose concentr ation of \n<56 mg/dL ( ≤3.1 mmol/L) wi ll be assessed as another set of key  efficacy endpoints.  \n3) Insulin dose: Since the continuation of sitagliptin may  result in better gl ycemic efficacy  by  \ncontrolling fasting and postprandial glucose, it is possible that a lower dose of insulin is \nrequired in subjects who continue sitagliptin.  Therefore, determination of the placebo -\nadjusted change from baseline in insulin dose will allow the assessment of the effect that \nrandomized withdrawal of sitagliptin has on the dose of insulin achieved through intense \ntitration of insulin glargine (LANTUS®).\n4) Fasting plasma glucose (FPG): Placebo -adjus ted changes from baseline in FPG will allow \nthe assessment of the effect that randomized withdrawal of sitagliptin has on measure s of \nfasting glycemic control.

Dr. Lindberg,  the study statistician , and the project manager will work \nclosely to establish and monitor the data management procedures for this study. The study \nstatistician  will perform or directly oversee all data anal yses.  \n \nStatistical Analysis  \nBefore any analyses are carried out, the data will be audited for quality, completeness, and \nevaluation of distributions with reference to planned analysis models. The evaluation of \ndistributions will include the detection  of ou tliers in quantitative data and checking distributions \nof variables to ensure that they meet the a ssumptions of planned analyses.  Whenever possible \nwe will use analytical techniques that allow us to keep the natural distribution of the variables, \nbut will consid er transformation if necessary.  \nThe main analysis will be based on intention -to-treat principles. To test the effect of the \nintervention on the short term outcomes at 6 months, we will use a residualized change score to \ndetermine whether the interven tion and control groups differ in change in outcome (e.g., weight \nand HbA1c) from baseline, controlling for baseline values. The analysis uses regression with the \ndependent variable being the change in weight (or HbA1c) at 6 months and the independent \nvari ables are baseline weight (or HbA1c) and a dummy variable for study arm (intervention \nversus control). To examine the long -term effect of the intervention we will use multilevel \nmodeling to examine the trajectory of the outcomes across baseline, 6, 12, and  18 months.  \nWeight (or HbA1c) is the dependent variable; time, study arm, and the time by study arm \ninteraction are the independent variables. Quadratic models will be fit to the data, as it is \nanticipated that the change over time will not be linear thro ughout the 18 month period. These \napproaches will also be used for the analysis of the short -term and long -term effects of the \nintervention on other outcomes: waist circumference,  fasting glucose, serum lipid profile, dietary \nintake  (total energy, simple c arbohydrates, saturated fat, number of servings of fruits and \nvegetables, dietary fiber and whole grains ), and PA.  \n \nAssessment of success in sustainability  phase  \nTo evaluate the success of the implementation of the intervention into clinical practice at \nVG MHC, the average percent age  of behavioral strategies, participant objectives, session \ncontent completed across sessions, average number of participants recruited, average \nparticipant satisfaction, percent of sessions attended in each phase, and average wei ght \nchange will be reported. These numbers will be compared to the benchmark numbers \nestablished during the clinical trial phase of the study.  \n \nAdditional Analyses  \nWe will also examine health literacy and numeracy and acculturation as potential moderators of \nthe impact of the intervention by including interaction terms in the residualized change and \nmultilevel models.  Acculturation and health literacy and numeracy will be added to the models \nas main effects along with the interaction of these variables and  the study arm.  A significant \ninteraction would signify that the effect of the intervention varies by the level of the moderator. \nSince these analyses may not be sufficiently powered, effect sizes as well as statistical \nsignificance will be of interest.  We will also explore the effect of the intervention on quality of life \nover the 18 month period using the multilevel approach outlined above.  \n '],The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is 3.9-fold.

Some people may be uncomfortable 797 with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily diabetes habits.  798 \n Known Potential Benefits  799 \nIt is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an automated closed-800 loop system with anticipatory action to control glucose levels . The individual participant may not 801 benefit from study participation. 802 \n Risk Assessment 803 \nBased on the facts that (1) adults with diabetes experience mild hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 804 frequently as a consequence of th e disease and its management, (2) the study intervention 805 involves periodic automated insulin dosing that may increase the likelihood of hypoglycemia, and 806 periodic automated attenuation of insulin delivery that may increase the likelihood of 807 hyperglycemia, (3) mitigations are in place, and have been tested in prior studies using the 808 investigational device system in the home setting, that limit the likelihood of excessive insulin 809 dosing or prolonged withdrawal of insulin, and (4) rapid reversal of hypoglycemi a and 810 hyperglycemia can be achieved.. In addition, it is the belief of the investigators that this study 811 also presents prospect of direct benefit to the participants and general benefit to others with 812 diabetes. 813 ""],Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketone formation are all a 690 risk in participants with type 1 diabetes.
Hypoglycesmia,hyperglycemic and ketones are always a 689 risk in people with type 2 diabetes.22.

STUDY DESIGN  5.1.  Overall Design  The DPPOS is a prospective study of the effects of DPP interventions on continued prevention or delay of diabetes, and on preventing or ameliorating its complications, specifically diabetic microangiopathy, neuropathy, cancer and cardiovascular disease.  The rationale for the overall design is to provide maintenance of therapi es found to be effective in DPP to assess the long-term impacts on diabetes prevention and complications. All DPP participants were offered the opportunity to participate in the group lifestyle intervention protocol during the Bridge period, January through June 2002.  They were  offered the opportunity to continue a long-term maintenance of the lifestyle intervention program, consisting of quarterly Healthy Lifestyle Program (HELP) meetings through spring 2014.  In addition, DPP intensive lifestyle particip ants were offered 4 weekly or bi-weekly behavior boost sessions in groups twice yearly through 2014, and DPP metformin participants were  provided open label metformin (850 mg bid).  During DPPOS Phase 3 , participants will remain in their originally randomized treatment groups, except that those in the original troglitazone group are no longer being followed.  All participants will be offered a single Group Lifestyle (HELP) session annually.  Participants in the original metformin group will continue to receive study metformin per protocol.  Participants in the original ILS group will receive an additional “lifestyle check-up” during their annual visit.  These interventions  are summarized below:  \nDPP  DPPOS  Phases 1 & 2 DPPOS Phase 3 * \nIntensive lifestyle (ILS)  \nBlinded Metformin + standard LS  (MET) Blinded Placebo + standard LS (PLB) \nTroglitazone + standard LS (stopped in 1998) \n(TRO)  Boost L S + HELP  \nOpen label metformin + HELP  Group lifestyle (HELP only) Group lifestyle (until 2008) HELP plus a nnual lifestyle check -up \nHELP plus open label metformin HELP N/A \n*Single group lifestyle session offered annually to a ll participants  \nDuring DPPOS Phases 1 & 2, participants had twice-yearly scheduled visits.  During \nDPPOS Phase 3, participants will have an annual in-person visit. The mid- year assessment will be conducted by telephone, unless an in- person visit is required or is requested by the participant. Study outcomes, including health outcomes assessment s , a brief medical history, fasting and OGTT blood draws, questionnaires, anthropometric measures , fundus, and neurologic examinations, and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis are performed as stipulated in Section 12. \nAssessment of microangiopathic, cancer , and cardiovascular outcomes will be performed in both diabetic and non-diabetic DPP participants during all years of the DPPOS.  Both individual and composite outcomes will be assessed.  The long-term effects and cost- effectiveness of interventions on the incidence and determinants of these outcomes will be assessed based on the original randomly assigned interventions during DPP.   In addition to the primary and secondary objectives, separate analyses will be performed to assess the importance of development of diabetes and other determinants on the development of microangiopathic, cancer and cardiovascular outcomes. Subgroup analysis will be performed based on sex, age and race/ethnicity.  '],The DPPOS Phase 3 study will examine the pathophysiology of diabetes complications.
The study is based on the DPPO cohort, with its IGT and T2DM subjects.
This is the first time the group has been examined by the DPDOS Phase III.,The intensive lifestyle and metformin therapy decreased the development of diabetes by 58% and 31% risk reduction.
The therapies were effective across all ethnic and racial groups and in men and women.
In men and woman, intensive lifestyle was significantly more effective than metformins.,DPPOS Phases 1 & 2 were first to be diagnosed in September 2002.
The study was conducted by George Washington University.
A total of 770 DPPOS participants had been diagnosed with diabetes.
An additional 824 participants have developed diabetes.22.
